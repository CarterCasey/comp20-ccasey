# Lab 7 - Captain's Log

## Correct Implementation

To my knowledge, everything for this lab was correctly implemented.  
That includes:  

* Update DOM for every new input using jQuery.
* Maintain entries in local storage so that page reloads with same messages.
* Use the Date javascript "object" (I just used Date without new, it was easier) to display a timestamp for each user input.

* I also attempt to sanitize input, to avoid client side script injection.


## Collaboration

I did not collaborate with anyone on this project, and only discussed it with Ming.  

## Time Taken

I spent about an hour to an hour and a half on this lab.
