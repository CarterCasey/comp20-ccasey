# Repository for Comp 20 - Web Programming

The following are questions for Lab 9 of this class:  

## What is this purpose of this Git repository?

This was the git repo we used to submit the bulk of assignments and labs for Comp 20 - Web Programming at Tufts.  

## What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was probably making my personal website, with building the front-end of Marauder's Map a very close second. Both of these assignments showed me that I could build something real and interesting on the Web, which is something I'd never done before. My personal website is something I'll probably use and change for a long time, and knowing I could just write the code that produces it was very important. The Marauder's Map project was just fun, and showed me how immediately I could access real facets of the Web (Google Maps API? super simple).  

## How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I think I've grown a decent amount, though most of what I've learned is simply confidence with the material.  

## What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

The most important thing I learned from this course alone (I was also taking networks, and so learned some things about servers concurrently) could be the structure of HTML. I hadn't conceptualized it as a tree, and being able to manipulate HTML in an intuitive way is very powerful.  

This means I now know how dynamic content can be generated using javascript: manipulate the tree at the branch you want. Add subtrees, move them around, delete them - everything is based on simple operations like this.  

It also means I know what structures to look for if I'm trying to analyze the structure of a Web page. Web scraping isn't the most elegant of arts, but it's useful and can provide you with a lot of data if done right.  

## Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I'd like to build a real, interesting website. I have no idea what that would be, but something that I, and other people, actually find practical.
